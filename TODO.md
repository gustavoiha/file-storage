# Repository TODOs

- [ ] Vaults page: show 3 featured metrics for each vault, including total number of files, total size, and one additional metric (for example: last upload date).
- [ ] Backend/API: tighten CORS `allowOrigins` from `*` to the actual dev domain once the final local/dev domain setup is in place.
- [ ] Backend: replace `ScanCommand` in `purgeReconciliation` with a GSI query.
